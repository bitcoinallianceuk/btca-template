Manifesto
=========

###Our mission is to help people exchange resources and ideas more freely.


We approach that mission with Bitcoin’s technology and community as our focus. There is tremendous potential in Bitcoin — from the opportunities it creates for entrepreneurs to the purchasing power it provides for citizens of countries large and small. Our goal is to help Bitcoin deliver on that potential.

This Bitcoin Foundation Chapter has chosen two primary objectives for fulfilling its mission. We believe that these activities will be of the greatest benefit to the Bitcoin community:


###Protecting Bitcoin

Cryptography is the key to Bitcoin’s success. It’s the reason that no one can double spend, counterfeit or steal Bitcoins. If Bitcoin is to be a viable money for both current users and future adopters, we need to maintain, improve and legally protect the integrity of the protocol.

###Promoting Bitcoin

In the context of public misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations, Bitcoin needs to be clearer about its purpose and technology. Allowing the community to speak through a single source will enable Bitcoin to improve its reputation.
