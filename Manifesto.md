Manifesto
=========

###Our mission is to help people exchange resources and ideas more freely.


We approach that mission with Bitcoin's technology and community as our focus. There is tremendous potential in Bitcoin - from the opportunities it creates for entrepreneurs to the purchasing power it provides for citizens of countries large and small. Our goal is to help Bitcoin deliver on that potential.

This Bitcoin Alliance Chapter has chosen four primary objectives for fulfilling its mission. We believe that these activities will be of the greatest benefit to the Bitcoin community:


###Education

Educating the mainstream in the uses and benefits of Bitcoin. Helping non-technical users to understand how to make use of the technology and where appropriate providing more technical education to those that want or need it.

###Adoption

Furthering the adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method, whether as a primary or secondary mean of value exchange. Despite the technical underpinnings the barriers to entry are actually less than currently available traditional methods and the community should be helping local businesses to overcome the technical and usability hurdles that currently stand between themselves and using Bitcoin.

###Promotion

In the context of public misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations, Bitcoin needs to be clearer about its purpose and technology. Allowing the community to speak through a local source will enable Bitcoin to improve its reputation.

###Connection
 
The goal is to align groups interested in bitcoin throughout the UK which may be too small to stand on their own. They can then consider themselves a member of this Alliance enabling members to pool and share resources when the need is required, be it for marketing, promotion or technical resources.
